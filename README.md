# 🧪 Quote Generator — API Study Project

This is a simple **quote generator** project built as part of my exploration of **JavaScript APIs and the `fetch()` method**. The UI is clean and responsive, with a frosted glass effect and a dynamically centered button


## 🔍 Purpose

This mini-project was created to:

- Learn how to use the `fetch()` API in JavaScript
- Understand how to parse and display JSON data from a public API
- Practice responsive layout using **Flexbox**
- Experiment with **Glassmorphism UI design**
